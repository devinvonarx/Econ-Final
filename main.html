            <p>Our project is an investigation into the world of crossword puzzles, and the finances behind them. We decided to investigate the economics of crossword puzzles simply because we love them. Both of us complete <em>The New York Times</em> Mini Crossword every morning with enthusiasm, and occasionally attempt the full puzzle as well. </p>

            <p>The crossword puzzle industry started in 1913 with the publication of the first newspaper crossword puzzle. By 1924 it had exploded in popularity culminating in a crossword puzzle book published as a small print run by Simon and Schuster, the popularity of the book launched them as a major publishing company. Crosswords continued to expand in popularity and by 1941 every major newspaper in America published a crossword puzzle except for <em>The New York Times</em>. When <em>The Times</em> finally gave in to the demand and began publishing a puzzle in 1942 they hired Simon and Schuster’s puzzle editor, Margaret Farrar, to manage it.

            <p>The early economic history of newspaper crosswords is an economic model based on small part time puzzle makers submitting puzzles for small fees which are edited and then published. For <em>The New York Times</em>, this model remains mostly unchanged, although puzzle submitters are paid more today and the puzzle editor has a staff of three to help out. For many other papers, however, the model has shifted. They now buy crosswords from a syndicate rather than individual submissions. This means that many papers now offer the same puzzle meaning the puzzle is less of a unique profit driver.

           <p>When interviewing expert crossword maker Brendan Quigley, he stated that the increase in crossword puzzles has increased greatly in the past two years, explaining that “the jump during COVID was stratospheric. The number of people who got into solving and/or making puzzles starting in 2020 was brain-scrambling. I got a lot of lovely letters from strangers who said my puzzles helped them through some pretty dark times.” This interest would equate to a rightward <strong>shift in demand</strong> for crossword puzzles. <strong>Shifts in demand are caused by either increases or decreases in demand. Shifts in demand are affected by the prices of related goods and services, consumer preferences, demographic characteristics/population, income, and buyer expectations.</strong> There are multiple possible explanations for the rise in interest and shift in demand for crossword puzzles. The easiest explanation is quite simple; beginning in March of 2020, the majority of the population found themselves without work or school to take up their day, and were left with an excess of time to play games. In addition, crossword puzzles are relatively inexpensive or even free, which makes them a perfect game for those suffering an economic recession like the one started by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

            <p>According to a survey conducted on the teachers of the LOHS English department, they would be willing to pay an average of $160 dollars for a yearly subscription to <em>The New York Times</em> crossword puzzle. With the price of said subscription being only $40, they have a <strong>consumer surplus</strong> of $120. <strong>A consumer surplus is defined as “the difference between the price a consumer pays for an item and the price he would be willing to pay rather than do without it”</strong> (Corporate Finance Institute). The consumer surplus for the rest of the school population might not be as high, but our English teachers greatly appreciate their daily puzzle!

          <h2>Future of the Industry:</h2>
         <p>I think we'll see more mini-puzzles like Wordle take off. There is so much content fighting for people's time nowadays, and bite-sized puzzles will probably go on a bit of a resurgence. But on the whole, I think the crossword is very healthy. The English language is constantly changing, so there will always be words to play with. Plus it's a classic now. It's like one of the first things you think of when you hear "puzzle."

          <p>The monopolistic competition graph has a downward sloping demand curve. The demand is somewhat elastic because the products are differentiated in a monopolistic competition market structure. <strong>Differentiated products are unique but not drastically different from other businesses’ products within the same industry.</strong> All this to say, although the products are differentiated, they are very similar and are close substitutes to one another. If one business raised its prices too much, consumers could simply buy a similar product from a different company. 
            <br><br>
            <srong>The marginal revenue curve is also downward sloping but at a steeper slope than the demand curve. The marginal revenue is the revenue that is gained after producing one more unit of a product.</strong>
            <br><br>
            The marginal cost curve is upward sloping. <strong>Marginal cost is the cost that is created from producing one more unit of a product.</strong> The average cost curve is a positive parabola and simply shows the business’ average costs.
            <br><br>
            In a monopolistic competition market structure, the business produces at the quantity where the marginal revenue and marginal costs curves intersect. The product is priced from that point up to the demand curve.</p>

       <p>The crossword puzzle industry makes <strong>zero economic profit</strong> in the <strong>long run. Also known as normal profit, zero economic profit is equal to a profit of $0. In addition, in economics, the long run is a period of time where all factors of production and costs are considered variable.</strong> The market is a <strong>monopolistic competition</strong> market structure, which is <strong>“a type of market structure where many companies are present in an industry, and they produce similar but differentiated products. None of the companies enjoy a monopoly, and each company operates independently without regard to the actions of other companies. The market structure is a form of imperfect competition”</strong> (Corporate Finance Institute). Monopolistic competition also means that businesses have <strong>low barriers to entry, which are costs or other factors that might prevent new businesses from entering a market or industry.</strong>

        <br><br>However, <em>The New York Times</em> makes a <strong>positive economic profit because it has name recognition and thus can charge above the industry price.</strong>
