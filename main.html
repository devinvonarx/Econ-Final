            <p>The crossword puzzle industry started in 1913 with the publication of the first newspaper crossword puzzle. By 1924 it had exploded in popularity culminating in a crossword puzzle book published as a small print run by Simon and Schuster, the popularity of the book launched them as a major publishing company. Crosswords continued to expand in popularity and by 1941 every major newspaper in America published a crossword puzzle except for the New York Times. When the Times finally gave in to the demand and began publishing a puzzle in 1942 they hired Simon and Schuster’s puzzle editor, Margaret Farrar, to manage it.

            <p>The early economic history of newspaper crosswords is an economic model based on small part time puzzle makers submitting puzzles for small fees which are edited and then published. For the New York Times this model remains mostly unchanged, although puzzle submitters are paid more today and the puzzle editor has a staff of three to help out. For many other papers, however, the model has shifted. They now buy crosswords from a syndicate rather than individual submissions. This means that many papers now offer the same puzzle meaning the puzzle is less of a unique profit driver.
