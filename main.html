            <p>Have you ever wondered about the economics of crossword puzzles?</p> 
            <p>Our project is an investigation into the world of crossword puzzles, and the finances behind them. We decided to investigate the economics of crossword puzzles simply because we love them. Both of us complete the New York Times Mini Crossword every morning with enthusiasm, and occasionally attempt the full puzzle as well. </p>

            <p>The crossword puzzle industry started in 1913 with the publication of the first newspaper crossword puzzle. By 1924 it had exploded in popularity culminating in a crossword puzzle book published as a small print run by Simon and Schuster, the popularity of the book launched them as a major publishing company. Crosswords continued to expand in popularity and by 1941 every major newspaper in America published a crossword puzzle except for the New York Times. When the Times finally gave in to the demand and began publishing a puzzle in 1942 they hired Simon and Schusterâ€™s puzzle editor, Margaret Farrar, to manage it.

            <p>The early economic history of newspaper crosswords is an economic model based on small part time puzzle makers submitting puzzles for small fees which are edited and then published. For the New York Times this model remains mostly unchanged, although puzzle submitters are paid more today and the puzzle editor has a staff of three to help out. For many other papers, however, the model has shifted. They now buy crosswords from a syndicate rather than individual submissions. This means that many papers now offer the same puzzle meaning the puzzle is less of a unique profit driver.

          <h2>Future of the Industry:</h2>
         <p>I think we'll see more mini-puzzles like Wordle take off. There is so much content fighting for people's time nowadays, and bite-sized puzzles will probably go on a bit of a resurgence. But on the whole, I think the crossword is very healthy. The English language is constantly changing, so there will always be words to play with. Plus it's a classic now. It's like one of the first things you think of when you hear "puzzle."

          <p>The crossword puzzle industry makes zero economic profit in the long run. The market is monopolistic competition, meaning there are low barriers to entry for the crossword puzzle industry.
            <br><br>However, The New York Times makes a positive economic profit because it has name recognition and thus can charge above the industry price.
